Description:  This is a multithreaded program that parses input files passed in through stdin, passes each line into a queue
              where it is concurrently being dequeued and modified. Uses monitors to synchronize the queue operations to 
              prevent race conditions. After the lines have been modified, they are printed to stdout which can be redirected
              into an output file.
