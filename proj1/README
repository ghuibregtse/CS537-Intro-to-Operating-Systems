Description:    This program mimics the linux ps command. It gets a set of 
                arguments from the user when it is run which must be processed.
                These arguments tell the program what info is desired about each
                process or which process we want to look at in particular.
                Once the flags are set for the info desired about each process,
                the program iterates through /proc, finds all the processes that
                belong to the user, parses through each one's stat, statm, and
                cmdline psuedofiles to print out the desired info (state, utime,
                stime, vmemory, cmdline).
